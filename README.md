wunderlist-bookmarklet
======================

A bookmarklet for adding items to your Wunderlist.

The new Add To Wunderlist browser extensions are great, but they only work on desktop browsers.
This bookmarklet can be used on your mobile browser (Chrome/Safari on iOS) and works just like the extensions. 

You'll notice that you can't see the whole dialog when using the bookmarklet on you iPhone. As this is the standard wunderlist dialog there's currently no easy way to fix that. Adding items works great though.
